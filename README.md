## Customize Portfolio
- ### Colors:
  To customize the colors to the colors you want, CSS variables are used in the [index.css file](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/index.css). There you can update the variables to set your custom colors
   - ### Background Color: <br>
      To set a new background color, update the `--color-bg` CSS variable and set your custom color in rbg, hex,hsl.
     ```
     :root{
     --color-bg: YOUR CUSTOM COLOR CODE; //This line
     }
      ```
   - ### Background Color Variant: <br>
        To set a update background color variant , update the `--color-bg-variant` CSS variable and set your custom color in rbg, hex,hsl
     ```
     :root{
     --color-bg-variant: YOUR CUSTOM COLOR CODE; //This line
     }
      ```
   - ### Primary Color:<br>
        To update the primary color, update the  `--color-primary`CSS variable and set your custom color in rbg, hex,hsl.
     ```
     :root{
     --color-primary: YOUR CUSTOM COLOR CODE; //This line
     }
      ```
   - ### Primary Color variant: <br> 
      To update the primary color, update the  `--color-primary` CSS variable and set your custom color in rbg, hex,hsl.
     ```
     :root{
     --color-primary: YOUR CUSTOM COLOR CODE; //This line
     }
      ```
      
- ### Resume:
   To add your custom images to the project, do the following
    - Navigate to the [assets folder](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/tree/main/src/assets).
    - rename, save your resume as `CV.pdf` and move it into the assets folder.
    
 
    Note: If your resume is not in pdf format and you don't want to update it to PDF format, navigate to the [Call to action](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/Header/CTA.jsx) component and update the import statement to use your resume file 
    ```
    import CV from '../../assets/YOUR RESUME NAME' //update this line
     ```
     
     and you should be good to go on your resume.
     
- ### Social links: 
     In terms of Social media links, I used the `Linkedin`, `Github` and `Codewars` links in the [Header section](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/Header/HeaderSocials.jsx).
     If you want to use your own `Linkedin`, `Github` and `Codewars` links, 
     1. navigate to the [Header socials component](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/Header/HeaderSocials.jsx). 
     2. update the href attributes for the three links <br><br>
      
     
       <a data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-duration="1500"  href="YOUR LINKEDIN URL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><BsLinkedin/></a>
       <a data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-duration="1200" href="YOUR GITHUB URL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><FaGithub/></a>
       <a data-aos-duration="900" data-aos="fade-down"  data-aos-anchor=".header__socials"  href="YOUR CODEWARS URL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><SiCodewars/></a> 
      
      

    If you want to add some more links or you want to make changes to the current links and Icons
    1. Find the Icon you want to add from [React Icons website](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search)
    2. Import the Icon
    3. add a new href or update and existing one, put the icon you imported in the anchor tag. <br> <br>
    
  
      <a data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-duration="1200" href="YOUR URL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><YourIcon/></a>
      
  with that, you can add and remove social media links and icons.
  
  - ### About me:
    To customize the about me section, Navigate to the [about component](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/About/About.jsx)
    and then customize the `experience`, `collaborators` and `paragraph` as you see fit.
    
 - ### Experience: 
   To Add your experience and tech stack to the experience section, Navigate to the [Experience Component](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/Experience/Experience.jsx) and update jsx how you see fit.

  To update the services, navigate to the [Services Component](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/Services/Services.jsx)
  and update your services as you see fit.
  
 - ### Portfolio:
  To update the portfolio section to accomodate your own projects. First, navigate to the [Portoflio component](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/Portfolio/Portfolio.jsx) and then follow these steps; 
   1. Import all Images of your projects to the [assets Folder](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/tree/main/src/assets)
   2. update the projects array to look like the following;
   
     const projects = [ 
      { 
        name : {PROJECT NAME} , //Must match the name of the project on github
        deployedLink: "{LINK}", //Deployed link of your project
        image: require('../../assets/{THE IMAGE RELATED TO THIS PROJECT}'),
        fadeDuration:{ANIMATION SPEED}, // To set the animation speed
        description: //description of your project. Expects a string
        toolsUsed: [] // tools used expects an array of Strings to represent each tool
      }
    ]
     
  After making these changes, your project should be rendered on the page just as usual.
      
 - ### Reviews
  To update the reviews section, Navigate to the [Reviews Component](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/src/components/Review/Review.jsx).
  In the reviews component, update the `reviewsData` array to fit your reviews. To customize the reviewsData array, follows these steps
   1. upload the images for each reviewer and move them to your [assets folder](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/tree/main/src/assets).
   2. Once you've uploaded your images to the assets folder, import those images into the reviewData array;
      
    const reviewData = [
    {
      avatar: require('../../assets/REVIEWER'S IMAGE'), //Should be the image that was imported in the 1st step
      name: 'THE NAME OF THE REVIEWER',
      review: `YOUR REVIEW TEXT`
    } 
    ]
    
    Once you've updated the reviewData array, your reviews should be rendered on the page successfully.
    
- ### Contact:
     - #### Customize contact links:
       To customize the `Linkedin`, `Instagram` and `Email` links, Navigate to the href attributes of each element.

       2. linkedin: Update the linkedin link to `YOUR LINKEDIN URL`
       3. Instagram: Update the Instagram link to `https://ig.me/m/YOUR-INSTAGRAM-USERNAME` //sets you username open in the user's inbox

 ## How to Deploy to Github pages for free
 
 After customizing the website, you can deploy it to github pages for free by following these steps;<br>
 
   - Navigate to the [package.json file](https://github.com/Adarsh-Sharma783/Portfolio-React/blob/main/package.json)
   - Update the `homepage` in the package.json file
    ```
     {
     "homepage": "https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/NAME-OF-REPOSITORY",
     }
    ```
      
      Make sure both your github username and the name of the repository on GitHub are spelt correctly.
    Note: you don't need to update the scripts because the scripts have been updated for you.
    
   - open up your terminal and run the command `npm run deploy`. This will take some time so grab your popcorn and wait for it to finish.
   - finally, you new portfolio website should be deployed to GitHub. your website link should be <br> `https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/NAME-OF-REPOSITORY-ON-GITHUB/`
